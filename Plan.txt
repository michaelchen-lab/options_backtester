<<Options Backtesting Tool>>

List of tests implemented:
  a. Pre-earnings long straddle
  b. Long Put/Call calendar during term structure inversion
  c. Iron Condor/Butterfly w/o IV and volatility filters

List of data available:
  1. EOD Options data (2002-2018)
  2. EOD Stock data (~20 years depending on symbol)
  3. Earnings data (~8 years depending on symbol)
  4. Stocks VIX data (2002-2018)

List of programs:

  1. Config file (Input)
    - Type of Backtest
    - List of symbols, Time period
    - Init. Liquidity, Position sizing, Commissions, Theo. bid-ask slippage
    - Applicable parameters (e.g. IV and ATR filter, no. of days before earnings)
    - Trade Closing parameters: Prof. target, stop loss, min. DTE

  2. MAIN program
    - Processes Config file
    - Uses the data programs to find symbols and dates that match criteria
      (Inputs: Time period, applicable parameters)
    - Uses the options program to execute all trades
      (Inputs: All dates to open trade, trade strategy, DTE(s), Delta, Closing parameters)

  3. Data programs

    a. Earnings data program (for pre-earnings test)
      - Processes CSV file containing earnings date
      - Returns a list of dates which are a specific no. of days before earnings

    b. Stock data program (for IC/IB test)
      - Processes the ALPHAVANTAGE API or stock CSV file to collect data
      - Calculate data (e.g. ATR, BBANDS)
      - Returns a list of dates where the selected criteria is met

    c. Stocks VIX data program (for IC/IB test)
      - Processes stocks VIX CSV file
      - Returns a list of dates where the selected IV criteria is met

    d. Term Structure data program (for LPC test)
      - Processes a Pandas Dataframe sent by the Execution Program (All options by one symbol of one day)
      - If criteria is met, it returns True/False

  4. Execution programs

    a. Execution program
      - Processes the daily options CSV file of time period set by user
      - Open positions according to entry inputs sent by MAIN program
      - All trades (expired and existing are recorded by Portfolio program)
      - If portfolio is holding options, the positions must be check for exit inputs
      - Long Call/Put Calendar function:
        1. Sends a Pandas DataFrame of All options by one symbol of one day to Term Structure data program.
        2. If data program return True, execute trade.
        (This is to increase the speed of the code)

    b. Portfolio program
      - Records all opening and closing trades sent by Execution program
      - Keeps two Pandas DataFrames:
        1. Existing positions
        2. Closed positions
